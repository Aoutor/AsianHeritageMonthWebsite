<p> <img src="Factories.jfif" width="150px"> In 1990, David Suzuki co-created the David Suzuki foundation. The foundation had the goal of reversing climate change, and also focused its efforts into topics such as producing clean energy, sustainable fishing and oil spill prevention. Suzuki has also preached his ideas towards universities across the world, such as McGill university. Suzuki encourages students to accept that the existence of climate change is real, and to agree that change must be done to prevent it. Suzuki also states that factories that produce coal or oil are to blame for this recent increase in global warming. Aside from the large amount of emmissions these companies produce, they also use their influence and wealth to sway the media into believing climate change is a hoax. 

David has also made a challenge for himself to reduce his carbon footprint (to reduce his carbon usage). David Suzuki is required to travel all across Canada in order to present his speeches about the environment and nature. However, travelling on an airplane or on a car can produce large amounts of carbon emmissions into the air. This is harmful towards our climate, and therefore Suzuki has stated he will avoid travelling through cars or airplanes. Instead, he will present his speeches through an online zoom call, or a livestream on youtube.
